# React1
#Project 1.b
React project based on mapping and using arrays .
Here I have added both the css and the normal file .
Here the form will show the pet adoption feilds.The functionality part of the form is done by me and the UI part is finalised with the help of some bootstrap tools and the copilot.
Here my main act was to jsut learn all the ways to use the keys,arrays and the mapping in the REACT.The same is beign used by me to show the data that is beign entered by the user on the screen in form of the tables .
